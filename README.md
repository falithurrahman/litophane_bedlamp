### Description

This time i made a litophane bedlamp for my college friend that just graduated. For you that don't know what litophane is, you can read the description [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithophane). In short, litophane is an artwork that can only be seen clearly when we give back lit with a light source. It can be a lamp, LED or even candle. 

First step to make this bedlamp is get the picture. It can be any picture of your desire. Then you can upload the picture to "picture to 3D" online converter like here or here. For this project, i used the service provided by 3dprocks.
